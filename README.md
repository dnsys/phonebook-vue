# This is test app for learning VUE.JS

> I made this project just for learning VueJS. This is the simple project that contains phonebook and management of it (add, delete, sort). Also i added auth for this app. The application backend is based on Firebase

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
